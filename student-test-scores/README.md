# student-test-scores
Data Science Pipeline from EDA to Modeling using sklearn and Student Test Scores Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s6e1/data .

### Objectives
- Create a good EDA.
- Create scikit-learn pipelines to compare different regression models.
- Interpret and validate final model. 

### Pipeline
- EDA
  - Initial Data Inspection
  - Data quality
  - Univariate analysis
  - Bivariate analysis
- (Quick) Data Wrangling
- Feature Engineering
- Modeling
- Test
- Model interpretation
 
### Result
Ridge
- RMSE: 8.894
- MAE: 7.101
- R2: 0.778
- Residual mean: -5.607

### Cosiderations
Improvements from last project:
- Better EDA.
- Remebered to do Data Wrangling.
- Remebered to do Feature Engineering.
- Interpreted the final model.
- Cleaner code.
- Moved from google colab to personal PC, improving computational power and decreasing time.

Things to improve in next projects:
- Data Wrangling: dataset did not required Data Wrangling.
- Modeling: slow fit caused by large dataset.
- General: project time span to long. Limit time span from project start.
- Documentation: poor code documentation.
- Test: test dataset did not have y values because it is from a kaggle competition.
